# Laufzettels Search-and-Replace

Assist in the search-and-replace process of fixing the Laufzettel ITHDs.  
Typically used for the case where a field's value is too long.

Import the user script in TamperMonkey or something similar.  
The build is found at https://gist.github.com/ccjmne/ed00e22ba2a0c1ef21441ef1a3cb8045.
